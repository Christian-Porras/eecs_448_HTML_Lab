      <p class = "bio">Illidan Stormrage, also known as Illidan the Betrayer, is a fictional character created by Blizzard Entertainment.
      He was once a Nigth Elf but was corrupted by the skull of Guldan. After consuming the skull, Illidan became a black demon.
      When he was defeated by Arthas at the Frozen Throne, Illidan fled to Outland and eventually became the lord of Outland.
      With the new invasion of Azeroth by the burning legion, Illidan and his demon hunters are back to help defend Azeroth!</p>
